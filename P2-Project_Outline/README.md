For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My group project will be a family tree with some fetures that ones on the web don't have.

This project was motivated by the interest of the mother of a group member.  Many people like to have their family tree and it would be great to have the extra features.

### Features

1. user accounts (family members) -- all users will have to create an account and then log in with each visit (site will be for members only)
2. chart that shows connections -- there will be a chart that will show connections (and linked to menu of connections)
3. a note section that members can tell stories about the person -- family can tell what they remembered about a person or heard older family tell
4. forum that members can ask questions that others can answer -- if someone is trying to find out about a relative, others can anwer their question
5. reminders of personal events (member will choose whose reminders will be sent) -- this will remind a member of upcoming birthdays and anniversaries so they can send a card or send an email
6. a family tree display to print (the whole tree or branches) (the whole tree will be many pages)
