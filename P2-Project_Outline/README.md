# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview

a. with user accounts (family members)
b. chart that shows connections
c. a note section that members can tell stories about the person
d. forum that members can ask questions that others can answer
e. reminders of personal events (sort of like my idea below)

### Technologies

Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

1. login security,
2. a better understanding of the technologies, 
3. how to develop a chat room for family members. 
4. how to incorporate a note section and connect it to the person, 
5. how to create a monthly reminder feature (for personal events).
