# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My overview:

My group project will be a family tree with some fetures that ones on the web don't have.

This project was motivated by the interest of the mother of a group member.  Many people like to have their family tree and it would be great to have the extra features.

Our group's overview:

Our app will support the creation, editing, sharing and communication around a family tree. Some of our members have personal experience trying to research and build a tree with family members. This program will facilitate collaboration and produce a nice diagram to share.

### Features
My list of features:
1. user accounts (family members) -- all users will have to create an account and then log in with each visit (site will be for members only)
2. chart that shows connections -- there will be a chart that will show connections (and linked to menu of connections)
3. a note section that members can tell stories about the person -- family can tell what they remembered about a person or heard older family tell
4. forum that members can ask questions that others can answer -- if someone is trying to find out about a relative, others can anwer their question
5. reminders of personal events (member will choose whose reminders will be sent) -- this will remind a member of upcoming birthdays and anniversaries so they can send a card or send an email
6. a family tree display to print (the whole tree or branches) (the whole tree will be many pages)

Our group's list of features:
1. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page. A super user(s) will control access to family trees.
2. Create/Edit Person: Approved users will be able to create or edit entries in a family database. Alerts about edits will be posted to the bulletin board for the family.
3. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page. A super user(s) will control access to family trees.

### What I'll Have to Learn

My list of what I think I will have to learn:
I will have to learn:
1. login security
2. a better understanding of the technologies 
3. how to develop a chat room for family members
4. how to incorporate a note section and connect it to the person 
5. how to create a monthly reminder feature (for personal events)

Our group's list of what we think we will have to learn:
During the creation of this web application, I will dive deeper into database management â€“ through both the development of the family tree schema and probably the messaging feature.
